# Memory Game Project
A memory game where cards are displayed on a board and when clicked, are turned around. Each card has an icon on it and only two cards will have the same 
icon. The objective is to flip the corresponding cards resulting in a match, in as little time and as few moves as possible.

## Getting Started

Simply open the index.html in a web browser and enjoy.

## Built With

* [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) - jQuery used for some enhanced JS functionality

## Game Rules
* Match all the cards to win!
* If you click on the same card twice it will just hide it again and reduce the move made!
* The Timer is just there to time you! Try to beat your time everytime you play.
* There is no time limit
